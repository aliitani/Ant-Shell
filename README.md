  -I have used some of the list operators like '&&', '&', '||' and others
  -example:
    ls > file && cat < file
            OR
    ls && ls -l

  -I have used built in functions like cd, help, exit, history, and umask <br>
  -Using _GNU_SOURCE and c99 <br>
  -Might add more stuff later on. <br>
  -Enjoy! <br>
